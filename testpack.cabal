Description:
  Please note that this package is no longer maintained by its author!
  .
  Haskell Test Utility Pack for HUnit and QuickCheck testpack provides
  utilities for both HUnit and QuickCheck. These include tools for
  running QuickCheck properties as HUnit test cases, allowing you to
  combine both approaches in a single program. It also includes tools for
  more helpful displays of running progress in both HUnit and QuickCheck,
  additional generators for other types for QuickCheck, and shortcuts for
  quickly defining new test cases.
